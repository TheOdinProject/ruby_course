# Welcome to The Odin Project's Ruby Course
This repository contains the ruby course for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

Hi I am an important change 


The Odin Project (also known as TOP), is an open-source community for learning full-stack web development. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive curriculum to learn web development for free. We help our students to learn the skills and build the impressive portfolio of projects they need to get hired as a web developer.
